# Changelog

## 0.9.1

### Fixes
- The `tack` skill now points agents at `tack init <slug> --group tangent` for tangent routes. Previously it referenced `--tangent`, an unimplemented flag, so agents following the skill hit "Unknown option: --tangent" at runtime.
- `tack recent --since <value>` now reports an error when the value isn't a parseable date. Previously it silently filtered out every route, which looked like "no recent routes" rather than "your input is wrong."

### Other
- Spec catches up to the shipped CLI: `tack edit`, `tack merge`, and `tack --version` are now formal requirements [CL-27], [CL-28], [CL-29].
- Wording tightened on [TK-04] (gating responsibility lies with the caller, not the CLI), [AG-02] ("background" → "without blocking the user prompt"), and [AG-03] (matches the actual `UserPromptSubmit` + branch-slug heuristic, not the URL inference that never shipped).
- New `STATUS.md` tracks spec coverage (73/73 normative + 5 deferred) and an advisory backlog for the next audit.

## 0.9.0

### Features
- `SessionStart` hook now checks CLI wrapper freshness on every Claude Code session start, regardless of which surface invokes the CLI. Previously the freshness check lived in the `tack` skill, which only fired on skill invocation — consumers calling `tack` directly (other skills, shell, tooling) bypassed it. The hook compares `tack --version` against `plugin.json#version` and emits an `additionalContext` nudge when they differ; silent on match, silent when the CLI isn't on PATH, never blocks the session.

## 0.8.0

### Features
- `tack --version` (and `-v`) now reports the installed plugin version, sourced from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
- The tack skill now checks CLI freshness on session start. If the shell `tack` wrapper (from `/tack:install-cli`) is older than the running plugin, it surfaces a one-line note and offers to refresh.

### Other
- Reconciled version drift across manifests: `plugin.json` is now the single source of truth, and `package.json` is frozen as `"private": true` with a stub version. Prior releases had `plugin.json` and `package.json` versions diverging silently.
